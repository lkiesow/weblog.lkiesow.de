Using Motorcomm YT6801 Gigabit Ethernet Controller in Proxmox
=============================================================

> This guide is based on Proxmox 9.

You will need a network connection for the initial installation and configuration,
as well as for downloading the YT6801 driver.
Using a cheap USB Ethernet controller works well for this.

```sh
# Make sure latest updates are installed
apt update
apt upgrade

# Install kernel header and DKMS driver module
apt install proxmox-headers-6.14
wget https://deb.tuxedocomputers.com/debian/pool/main/t/tuxedo-yt6801/tuxedo-yt6801_1.0.30tux4_all.deb
apt install ./tuxedo-yt6801_1.0.30tux4_all.deb

# Build kernel module
dkms build tuxedo-yt6801/1.0.30tux4

# Reboot system to activate driver
reboot

# Check if driver is active
01:00.0 Ethernet controller: Motorcomm Microelectronics. YT6801 Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 01)
	...
	Kernel driver in use: yt6801
	Kernel modules: yt6801
```

Next, configure the network interface.
Either in `/etc/network/interfaces` or in the web interface.

To check if everything works, you can run:

```sh
ip a
ethtool enp1s0 | grep -i speed
ethtool vmbr0 | grep -i speed
```
